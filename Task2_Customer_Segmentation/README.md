Oasis Infobyte Internship – Task 2

Project: Customer Segmentation Analysis

Dataset Source: ifood_df.csv from Kaggle

Objective:
To segment e-commerce customers into meaningful groups using clustering techniques and generate actionable marketing insights.

Steps Performed:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Elbow method to determine optimal number of clusters (k)
- K-Means clustering (k = 2)
- Cluster labeling and profiling
- Visualizations: Pie chart, scatter plot
- Final recommendations

Files Included:
- `Customer_Segmentation.ipynb` — Full code and insights
- `Clustered_Customers.csv` — Final dataset with cluster labels

Key Insights:
- **Cluster 0:** Low-income, low-spending, low response to marketing
- **Cluster 1:** High-income, high-spending, responds well to campaigns

Business can use this to focus premium strategies on Cluster 1 and offer incentives to boost conversion in Cluster 0.
