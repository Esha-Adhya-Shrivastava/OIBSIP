Task 6 - Wine Quality Prediction

This is Task 6 of my Data Analytics internship at Oasis Infobyte.

Objective:
To predict the quality of wine based on its chemical features using different machine learning classifiers.

Dataset:
- Source: [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset)
- Includes features like:
  - Fixed acidity
  - Volatile acidity
  - Citric acid
  - Residual sugar
  - Chlorides
  - Sulphates
  - Alcohol, etc.

ML Models Used:
- Random Forest Classifier
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Tools & Libraries:
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

Outcome:
- Accuracy scores of all three models were compared
- Random Forest gave the highest accuracy
- Confusion Matrix was visualized for performance evaluation
